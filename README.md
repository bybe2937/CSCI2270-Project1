# CSCI2270-Project1
Sudoku Project

Our project will do a series of algorithms to not only solve sudoku boards given to it via text file but also give users the ability to solve boards that the program gives them. Continuing with our class theme of main menus, ours will consist of four different options for the user. The first is to create a new board with varying difficulties. The second is to be able to solve a board given to the program by a text file. The third is to save a board as a text file that a person is currently working on to allow them to finish or auto solve later. The last is to continue a board that they had saved previously.

MAIN MENU
  1. Create New Board
    a. Easy
    b. Medium
    c. Hard
  2. Solve Pre-Existing
  3. Write Board to File
  4. Continue Previous Board
  5. Quit


How	to Run
  Our program will work off all user cin commands because they will not always need to use command line arguements. The main menu is the bulk of how the program will run. We will need two different algorithms. One to create possible sudoku boards with three levels of difficulty and another to solve a board. We will also need to convert our program boards to simple text to write to a file. 

Dependencies
  We do not believe we will need any other dependencies besides the common c++ libraries.
  
System Requirements
  We so far have it working for any OS similar to all of the projects we have done so far in class.
